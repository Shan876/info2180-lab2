 	<p> If there is something in you,
        which you don’t like and cant bear try to remove that.
         Try to improve yourself. It could be anything. 
         For example the way you talk and your communication skills.
          If that is the problem then practice talking. 
          Practice makes a man perfect and in this case a woman too! So practice and you will improve. 
          Likewise, if you don’t like the way you look because of the fact that you are fat,
           and then try to get rid of those few extra pounds to love yourself. 
           If may take in a little effort but you will gain a lot of satisfaction. 
           And that is what you need to love yourself and live a satisfied life!
 	</p> <p> Challenges are a part of life. We face different challenges at different points in life. While some people look at these challenges as an opportunity to learn something new others get disheartened and succumb to them. We learn many new things as we take on different challenges. These experiences make us a better person. We can overcome many challenges by setting goals. Goals give us the determination to achieve despite the hurdles.Life is a precious gift. It must be handled with care. We must be thankful to God for sending us on Earth and giving us such beautiful surroundings to live in. We must also be thankful to God for making us physically and mentally fit to live a wholesome life. Not just human beings, the life of animals, birds and plants is equally precious and we must value it too.

 	<p> but not always. It has lots of problems you have to face everyday.
        Don't worry though! All these problems make you strong, it gives you courage to stand alone in future.
         Life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success and comfort punctuated by misery, defeat, failures and problems.
          There is no human being on Earth, strong, powerful, wise or rich, who has not experienced, struggle, 
          suffering or failure. You have to work hard to reach to the highest position. Life is full of paths, you
           just have to choose the right one. Life is interesting and amazing like the stars up in the skies. <br> <br>
      
           Life is the place where people treat everyone differently, racism exists as well as bullying.
            People tend to say bad stuff behind people's back. 
            There are millions of people using horrible words to call people, People use people everyday. 
            Life is not that easy in my view. Sometimes, 
            all you want to do is sit alone and question yourself with hundred of questions</p>
